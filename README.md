## **Agile Planning**

Party Stars was developed with agile planning. This meant that each individual feature was split first into User Stories for what the user of the website would expect. Each User Story was thought about and planned out, which allowed me to create multiple tasks which would be developed to implement certain features and these Tasks were then grouped together into Epics.

Everything was labeled as Must Have, Should Have and Could Have to help prioritise which were most important to implement.

The Project board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/ionelaSabinaMacovei/projects/4).
